                <h3 class="spacer top">How Refunds  Work</h3>
                <p>Each Lurn course comes with its own refund policy. Depending on the course you purchased you may request a refund in a 30, 60, or 90 day time frame. Some courses come with a NO REFUND policy.</p>
                <p>The refund period starts from the day you purchased the product unless otherwise specified.</p>
                <p>Any and all physical materials you might have received, such as physical books, DVDs, CDs and the link, need to be returned to us in order for your refund to be processed.</p>
                <p>Of course, digital products you've downloaded cannot be "returned" to us, so we trust you to not re-sell or otherwise re-distribute those files. Also if you get a refund but continue to use a product you purchased from us it is a violation of intellectual property rights laws (in other words, it's stealing, and that's not right).</p>
                <h3 class="spacer top">How to Request  a Refund</h3>
                <p>Simply email your refund request to <a href="mailto:support@lurn.com">support@lurn.com</a>. Please include the words “Refund Request” in the subject  line of your email to help us get to it quickly.</p>
                <p class="spacer top"><strong><em>IMPORTANT REFUND INFORMATION</em></strong>: It may take up to 7 business days for your refund to be credited back to your account.</p>
                <p>Most of our products have a no-refund policy, however, we do have a 3 day cancelation policy in place for products that are over $25. Should you find after 3 days that you want a refund, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@lurn.com" target="_blank">support@lurn.com</a> and ask for a refund of your payment. After 3 days we incur costs (e.g. coaching calls, community, and software) and therefore, can no longer offer a refund.</p>
                <p>It would be very helpful to us if you'd also tell us why you're requesting a refund. This is NOT required, and we won't use this information to try and "sell" you something else. But we do take feedback seriously, and it really does help us make better products and improve our sales process. We want every customer to be satisfied!</p>
                <p>This refund policy was last updated on July 19, 2016.</p>
