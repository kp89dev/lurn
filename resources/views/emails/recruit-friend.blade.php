## Hey there,

I wanted to share this with you.

I just got a free account at "Lurn Nation" and thought of you. 

It's basically a free to use online "hub" that has tons of free courses and trainings. I haven't even looked at everything yet but I saw courses there on how to start your own email business, marketing, how to use Facebook, YouTube, how to get free leads from Instagram - and they even have ecommerce training (for Shopify).

And it's 100% free.

So, I'm just passing it on to you because I thought you might get a lot of this too ðŸ™‚. You can check it out here if you'd like:

[Join the Lurn Nation invitation-only launch!]({{ $referral_link }})

Let me know if you sign up to so we can chat about it!

Cheers,

{{ $user->name }}
